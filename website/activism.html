          <td><p>A big part of making a change in the world is getting the government to help your cause and others to join it. One of the best ways to do this is to take a stand and rally for what you
            feel is right. When people stand together it is hard to deny that fixing climate change is a movement backed by the people.</p>

          <td><p>Individual government officials are those who are able to help promote climate change to the rest of the government, as well as they are the ones that can cause policy change. By taking
            a more personal approach to sway them to help such as writing them a letter you are able to show that you care to those that have the power. The power of words and storytelling is a great tool
            to getting someone to care and help make a change. Letter writing is even helpful towards local schools, and other community organizations, because they may have the power to change their ways
            or influence a different demographic to help.</p><a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/content-types/writing-effective-letters/" target="_blank"><p>Link to tips on how to write an
