    <h2>Transforming Facial Technology</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <video controls><source src="images/aiface.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p>This project was for vis 145a in which I reimagined facial recognition technology. I did this
        in order to comment on how facial recognition technology is not currently accurate and instead 
        is often very discriminatory. I used Processing to utilize the computer camera and an AI software
        that is able to recognize facial features to show the inacurracies of this technology and make an
        art piece out of it.

    <h2>Everything Has a Meaning</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <video controls><source src="images/meaning.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p>For my final project I wanted to look at the meaning behind colors and what colors in the world about 
        you make you feel and mean. In today's society each color has so many different meanings and is used 
        to elicit specific responses from consumers and people in general to get them to have a certain reaction 
        to an object. This project shows some of my capabilities with working on physical technologies such as 
        arduinos and using sensors.

    <h2>Tiktok Immediacy</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <video controls><source src="images/tiktok.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p>This project was created as a commentary on todays society and how we want immediate feedback.
        It was a prototype for an overlay on tiktok that would artistically comment on how you are interacting
        with tiktok the app. This was created in processing and shows my creativity as well as how I am able to 
        make interactive applications.

    <h2>Light Painting</h2>

    </div>
    <p>My inspiration for my generative art was the city at night and past photography that I have done 
        involving light and how long exposure shots create paths of light if the photographer or the light
         itself is moving. When playing around with the camera I noticed how the lights can move in different
          ways and come in many colors. For this project I decided to create a program in which the user 
          picks an area to start each path but the computer randomly generates the length and path that the 
          “light” takes. There is also a mode in which the user can pick the colors of the “light” and a way 
          to reset the canvas.

    <h2>Climate Together Website</h2>

    </div>
    <p><a href="website/index.html" target="_blank">Climate Together</a></p>
    <p>This website was created for the final project in a Warren writing class.
        This class was on climate change and I chose to display what I learned and researched
        through a website. This shows some of my simple website creation that I have done for past classes.
